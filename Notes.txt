before you start, when using Ansible Automation Platform on RHEL with SE Linux there are limitations on writing to a folder when using EXPOSE Paths

You must modify the directory you intend to use by changing the folder datatype to allow containers to write to it, if it is not you will get Access Denied.


Here is an example of a commands that you should do to a folder (AS ROOT)

mkdir /f5data
chown awx:awx /f5data
chmod 775 /f5data
chcon -t container_file_t /f5data

this will allow /f5data when passed through in AAP as a exposed path (Note that /mnt/apps is a SAMBA Share mounted to /mnt/apps directory but can be used)

Here is the example of that section, rw = Read/Write, ro = Read Only

[
  "/etc/pki/ca-trust:/etc/pki/ca-trust:O",
  "/f5data:/f5data:rw",
  "/mnt/apps:/mnt/apps:ro",
  "/usr/share/pki:/usr/share/pki:O"
]
