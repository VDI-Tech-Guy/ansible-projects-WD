# A bit of bash trickery here.  An ls is done which removes fluff, orders it and so on.  Then we grep
# for the inventory_hostname (assuming there will be many hosts this is running or has been run against) to
# make sure we only look for THIS host.  The we grep for BEFORE and pipe to tail -n 1 to make sure we get
# the 'last one'.
